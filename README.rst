Discription
^^^^^^^^^^^

Do you like modifiers? Then you will love this mod!
Imagine modifiers but they are 100X worse and spawn randomly every 10-5 seconds!
This is a small project delevoped by Me and my freind M4X4 and we hope you have fun playing!
For any "scripters" (god i hate this word) who are interested in our methods we use absolutely zero obfuscation so go ahead and have fun! pls give credit if you republish your own version!
